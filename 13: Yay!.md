# AUR Helper - Yay

> **Yay** is a modern **AUR** helper written in the **GO** language. It has very few dependencies and supports AUR tab-completion so that you donâ€™t have to type the commands in full. Just type the first few letters and hit ENTER.

```bash
$ cd /opt # Installation path
$ sudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-git.git # Cloning the repo from AUR
$ cd yay-git # Navigation may require changing folder permissions
$ makepkg -si # Make the package to be honest.
```
