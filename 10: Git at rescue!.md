# [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

> Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

# Installation

```bash
$ sudo pacman -Syu git
```

Yay! I guess... You can write more shit and then revert back from it!
